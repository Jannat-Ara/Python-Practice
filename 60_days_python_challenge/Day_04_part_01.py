#Taking User Input in Python
a =input("Enter the name:")
print(a)

x = input(" Enter the first number:")
y = input(" Enter the second number:")
print(int(x)+ int(y)) # you have to typecast it otherwise the x and y are counted as string and it's gonna concatinate the string and the output will be something like 1217.
